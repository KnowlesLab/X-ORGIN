# X-ORGIN
XOrigin is a pipeline designed for estimating expansion origins from derived SNPs, which incorporates temporal and spatial heterogeneities. It is best suited for estimating refugia for species that experienced distributional shifts during last glacial maximum. The pipeline is dependent on SPLATCHE2 for spatially-explicit demographic simulations, and makes use of the spatial statistics Psi to estimate expansion origins.
